Thank you for signing up for the "Data Wrangling for Economists with Stata and the Command Line" workshop accompanying the [EEA Virtual Congress](http://www.eeavirtual.org/). This email contains important details about how you can join the workshop, please read it carefully.

## Be kind
This is a Carpentries workshop, so please review our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct-summary-view). The short summary is to be kind and encouraging to your fellow learners, helpers and instructors.

## Join our Slack
We will use Slack to communicate before and during the workshop. This is where we can share installation instructions, help debug errors and discuss questions in more detail. (Audio questions are also encouraged on Zoom.)

Use [this link to join our Slack team]({{ site.data.secrets.slack.invite }}). Please set your display name to your full name or your preferred name.

### Channels
When joining, you will become a member of the following channels:
- #welcome: This is where we share general messages and instructions. Feel free (but not obliged) to say a few words about yourself to your fellow learners.
- #shell: This where you can post shell-related questions which our awesome helpers will answer. We also encourage helping one another.
- #git: This where you can post git-related questions which our awesome helpers will answer. We also encourage helping one another.
- #stata: This where you can post Stata-related questions which our awesome helpers will answer. We also encourage helping one another.
- #coffee: This is where we can hang out in between sessions.

### Find your Zoom room
Live coding will take place in two Zoom rooms, "Blue" and "Orange." Instructors in both rooms will cover the same content, and learners have been equally split between the two.

You have been assigned to the Orange Room. We will share the Zoom login details closer to the workshop kickoff. Please join the [channel for your room]({{ site.data.secrets.slack.orange }}) on Slack. You can post questions here for your instructor or have a discussion with fellow learners during the live coding session. 

## Set up your computer
Throughout the workshop, we will be using `bash`, `git` and `Stata`. All three work on all three majors platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux. Follow the [setup instructions](https://korenmiklos.github.io/2020-08-23-eea/#setup) to install these on your personal computer.

If you get stuck during installation, ask a question on the respective [Slack channel]({{ site.data.secrets.slack.main }}) or join one of the [installation clinics](#installation-clinics) we are offering before the workshop.

Bash and Git are open source software, but Stata requires a license. We will be using Stata 16 Special Edition, but Stata 14 and up should also work fine. If you do not have Stata on your computer, ask for a free teaching version in the [`#stata`channel on Slack]({{ site.data.secrets.slack.stata }}). You will be able to use it until September 1.

### Sign up for GitHub
We will be using Git and GitHub for version control. If you don't yet have a GitHub account, [sign up here](https://github.com/join) *before* the workshop.

## Installation clinics
If you get stuck during installation, join us for one of our installation clinics. Details will be shared via Slack.

We are looking forward to welcoming you on Sunday.

Mikl√≥s

On behalf of the instructor team
