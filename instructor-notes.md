# Shell
# Git
We are using command line git to reinforce the concepts. At the end, you may show a GUI client to learners, but not before so as not to confuse them.

The lesson is following a GitHub-based workflow. Make sure everyone has a GitHub account *before* starting this lesson.

We are skipping Episode 5, "Labeling Things." In practice, it is quite rare that we need to check out an old commit. We are only teaching students how to make this possible with using proper version control.

Pushing and pulling (Episode 6) are importants parts of the GitHub-based workflow. If you finish early, Episode 10 about sharing repositories with others could be a good next step. 

# Data Wrangling with Stata
We are using Stata 16, but some learners may have earlier versions, so the lesson does not yet include data frames.

# Coding with Stata
The key mental model to share with learners:
1. Save every data manipulation step in a .do file
2. Use .do files as scripts creating (preferably one) output from inputs
3. So much so that these scripts may even be called from the command line

Getting this mental model across is the most important, everything else, like particular commands, are secondary.
